The outer parenths are not needed, multiplication works normally
Inner (i) is needed since i could be negative and it would eval to -i*5 which would be - (i*5) by mat




Both are necessary:
twice(2+1) would mess with it -- 4
(parents around i)


!twice(0) -- 1
-- this is !(0) * 2 which is 1 * 2
or just division of something with twice
(parens around everything) 

why not write something much simpler like a method or function????
function calls // stacks // memory issues? a lot of extra instructions with funcs or methods

nowadays not really an issue but its just for back then and better for constants
