Submit a file named q09 which contains your explanation (in English, not in C) as to why that
particular file is left empty rather than containing ‘‘hello’’.

The file03 is left empty rather than containing "hello".
This was along with file10 and file11.
file10 and file11 are empty because the loop in the helloer.c file only goes from 1 to 9.
The reason that file03 does not have hello in it is because of the stdin stdout annd stderr.
Those fd take up 0 1 and 2.
When we open the filename in buggy.c, the fd is now 3, because the lowest available fd is always assigned first.
When we dup2 3 onto 3, nothing happens however, when we close the fd 3, since originally it was 3, there is no change and therefore nothing will be written to file03 since fd 3 is now closed.
