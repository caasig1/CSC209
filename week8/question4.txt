fork
	makes 2 of the process
exec
wait

2 things
we do fork, -- one of the new ones is child the old one is parent (parent waits for child) -- same id process as before
one of the two processes do an exec call
the other process does wait and loops around to print the next prompt

eg calling ls means shell is parent, ls is the child
-- wait cos we want ls to complete before doing the next prompt
