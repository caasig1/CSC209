This works for all files, although it may mess with other parts of the code, if more were written.
When a string of longer than 50, in this case, is entered, it gets stored into a char array of 50, however, variables can accecss var[51].
This is because the c program stores arrays as pointers. By calling var[51], we are effectively sayins "Whatever is stored in the address of var + 51*(type of var)
For characters, the type of var is size 1 byte so it would just be var + 51.
If, let's say we enter an input of length 50, and the 51th index (not in the 'array' contained an e, for example, we would get the string back with an e on the end, since the string only detects end of string at '\0'
In this case, we read and store the values one after the other so, for strings longer than 50, we know that immediately after the fgets, var[51] and var[52] ... would still contain what we want, which is the string.
In this case, it doesnt matter however, this is a poor way to implement this, since it could overwrite other variables or other needed objects elsewhere in the code
