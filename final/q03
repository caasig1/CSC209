Let's say we have parent directory and we make a child directory.
Each time a child directory is created, there is a new link to the parent directory.
This is because directories :
(a) refer to themselves trough .
(b) refer to their parents as .. (or themselves if there is no parent directory, AKA you are at the root)
For directories like etc, they have many many child directories which means that they have many many links
