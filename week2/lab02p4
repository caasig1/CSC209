I believe my friend's program violates rule 3: Make programs' input formats easy to generate or type. More specifically, violating how the input should not be interactive.
It would also be easier to use my version if we were using a program which used this as a function. Using my friends method, you would need to create a new file which would be read as the input file before running the function. Using my method, you could simply add the parameters which can be done relatively simply using the $variable_name function of the shell to substitute numbers or variables as inputs.
Another issue with my friends program is that it violates rule 2: Except the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. This is violated because the output that is given is in the form of a sentence which does not lend itself to being read by another function.
It would be easier to use my version of the program if the output of this program was used by any possible other program. In the case of my friends program, another program would need to parse through the information and remove the unneeded english words in the output whereas my function would be very easily read by any other function.
